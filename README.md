txtstrap
========

Textpattern on Twitter Bootstrap, or the other way around.



### /txtstrap/assets

All assets references are in the the /_templates/forms/head.misc.txp and /_templates/forms/footer.misc.txp forms. Any changes to the directory structure for your projects will only require updating those paths in order for the whole txtstrap to still work drag-and-drop.
